This Foodapp project was mainly implemented using HTML,CSS and a little of Javascript.
The source code conatins all the necessary codes for the navigation bar, that conatins the Menu icon, Contact us icon, About us icon and the styling is done using CSS and Javascript.
The images are taken from google and added using HTML and CSS.
In this app you can order for momos amd soups which will be home delivered. You can provide your name, contact number and list of items to be delivered and the address to be delivered.
This is a very easy and eco-friendly mobile app which can be used anywhere and anytime with less amount of time and money.
Also the website is made responsive according to different screen sizes and different gadgets.
Media Query was used to make the screen responsive, breakpoints were added to certain parts of the design that will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.
I referred to several sources to create this app, where I got to learn many new techniques and simple ways to handle the project.
